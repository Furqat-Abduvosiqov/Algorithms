    /*
   A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
   Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index.
   If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
   You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞.
   In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.
   You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.
   Constraints:
   1 <= nums.length <= 1000
   -231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
   nums[i] != nums[i + 1] for all valid i.
